                    The Sri Yogeshwarananda English Primary, Middle and High School was started by Sri Yogeshwarananda
                    to teach people about
                    the great spiritual teacher Sri Ramakrishna and his message. Sri Ramakrishna's follower, Swami
                    Vivekananda, inspired many people
                    with his teachings. Swami Yogeshwarananda came to Bangalore in 1903 to share these ideas. The Mutt
                    has been around for
                    over 100 years and is now run to keep Swami Yogeshwaranandaji's dream alive. They welcome everyone
                    to learn and grow!
